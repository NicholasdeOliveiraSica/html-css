        <h2>Letra da musica Believer, imagine dragons</h2>
        <p>First things first <br>
            I'ma say all the words inside my head <br>
            I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh-ooh <br>
            The way that things have been, oh-ooh <br>
            Second thing second <br>
            Don't you tell me what you think that I could be <br>
            I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh <br>
            The master of my sea, oh-ooh <br>
            I was broken from a young age <br>
            Taking my sulking to the masses <br>
            Writing my poems for the few <br>
            That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me <br>
            Singing from heartache from the pain <br>
            Taking my message from the veins <br>
            Speaking my lesson from the brain <br>
            Seeing the beauty through the... <br>
            Pain! <br>
            You made me a, you made me a believer, believer <br>
            Pain! <br>
            You break me down and build me up, believer, believer <br>
            Pain! <br>
            Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain <br>
            My life, my love, my drive, it came from... <br>
            Pain! <br>
            You made me a, you made me a believer, believer <br>
            First things first <br>
            Can you imagine what's about to happen? <br>
            It's Weezy the Dragon, I link with the Dragons <br>
            And we gon' get ratchet, no need for imaginin' <br>
            This is what's happenin' <br>
            Second thing second, I reckon immaculate <br>
            Sound about accurate <br>
            I know that strength, it don't come, don't come without strategy <br>
            I know the sweet, it don't come without cavities <br>
            I know the passages come with some traffic <br>
            I start with from the basement, end up in the attic <br>
            And third thing third <br>
            Whoever call me out, they simply can't count <br>
            Let's get mathematic, I'm up in this, huh <br>
            Is you a believer? <br>
            I get a unicorn out of a zebra <br>
            I wear my uniform like a tuxedo <br>
            This dragon don't hold his breath, don't need no breather <br>
            Love you Ms. Cita, the son of a leader <br>
            I know the bloomin' don't come without rain <br>
            I know the losin' don't come without shame <br>
            I know the beauty don't come without hurt <br>
            Hol' up, hol' up, last thing last <br>
            I know that Tunechi don't come without Wayne <br>
            I know that losin' don't come without game <br>
            I know that glory don't come without... <br>
            Don't come without... <br>
            Pain! <br>
            You made me a, you made me a believer, believer <br>
            Pain! <br>
            You break me down and build me up, believer, believer <br>
            Pain <br>
            Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain <br>
            My life, my love, my drive, it came from... <br>
            Pain! <br>
            You made me a, you made me a believer, believer <br>
            Last things last <br>
            By the grace of fire and flames <br>
            You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh <br>
            The blood in my veins, oh-ooh <br>
            But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing <br>
            Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down <br>
            It rained down, like... <br>
            Pain! <br>
            You made me a, you made me a believer, believer <br>
            Pain! <br>
            You break me down and build me up, believer, believer <br>
            Pain <br>
            Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain <br>
            My life, my love, my drive, it came from... <br>
            Pain! <br>
            You made me a, you made me a believer, believer <br></p>
